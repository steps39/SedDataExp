## Sediment Data Explorer - Table of Contents - Generated by Google Notebook App

This table of contents outlines the functionality of a web application, "Sediment Data Explorer," built using JavaScript and various libraries, designed to visualize and analyze sediment sample data.

## Functionality:

The application provides an interface for users to upload sediment sample data files, visualize this data on maps and charts, and perform basic statistical analysis. It includes features to select and filter data, as well as highlight specific data points across various visualizations.

## Source Code Structure:

The table of contents is organized according to source code files, offering an overview of the application's functionality through the lens of its code.

### 1. SedimentDataExplorer.js

This file appears to be the main JavaScript file that orchestrates the application.

Global Variables and Initialization: Declares global variables like map for Leaflet map, sampleMeasurements for storing measurement data, and actionLevels for holding environmental safety thresholds. Initializes libraries such as Chart.js for visualizations and os-transform.js for coordinate conversions.
Data Import Functions: Defines functions like importChemInfo, importLocations, and importData to handle the upload and parsing of data from Excel files or URLs. These functions use the XLSX library to process spreadsheets and store the extracted data in appropriate JavaScript objects.
Data Processing Functions: Includes functions such as extractDataFromSheet to process the data extracted from individual sheets within uploaded spreadsheets. This function identifies key information like sampling dates, measurement units, and analytical data. Additional functions like cleanChemicalString and pahPostProcess handle data cleaning and specific calculations for PAH data.
Data Visualization Initialization: Sets up the initial display of the application, including creating canvases for charts (createCanvas), clearing existing visualizations (clearCanvasAndChart), and managing the display of uploaded file information (toggleFileDisplay).

### 2. sdeCharts.js

This file seems to handle the creation and manipulation of charts within the application.

Chart Data Preparation Functions: Contains functions like ringFractionsForPAHs, organochlorineDataForChart, and metalDataForChart that transform and structure the raw sample data into formats suitable for Chart.js. This involves calculations like ring size fractions, data normalization, and grouping by chemical types.
Color Gradient Generation: Defines a colorGradient function to generate color gradients for use in charts, allowing for visual representation of data ranges.
Chart Creation and Display Functions: Includes functions like displayPSDHighlight, displayAnyChart, displayMetals, and displayGorhamTest to create specific chart types using the Chart.js library. These functions configure various aspects of the charts, such as axes, titles, legends, and annotations, including environmental safety thresholds.
Chart Interaction Functions: Defines functions for handling user interaction with the charts. For example, clickableScales facilitates highlighting data points across multiple charts, getRandomColor provides random colors for visual distinctions, and functions like chartLine and chartLabel add annotations and visual cues to charts.
### 3. sdeDataUtilities.js

This file likely contains utility functions for data processing and calculations.

Data Summarization Function: Defines calculateSums function for calculating sums of specific chemical concentrations within sample data. This function groups and summarizes data by sample and chemical type, facilitating the generation of summary statistics.
PAH Data Processing Function: Includes pahPostProcess for performing post-processing calculations specific to PAH data. Calculates various PAH ratios, such as "IP/(IP+B(ghi)P)" and "BaA/(BaA+Chr)", and determines sums based on ring structures and environmental standards like Dash and EPS sums.
### 4. sdeDredgeData.js

This file focuses on handling data specific to dredging activities.

Dredge Data Structures and Variables: Defines variables and data structures like CEFASdata and ddLookup to store and access data related to dredging, including chemical names, corresponding sheet names, and measured concentrations.
Dredge Data Import and Processing: Includes functions such as importDredgeData to import dredging data from uploaded files or URLs. Functions like loadDredgeData and processDDExcelData handle the loading and parsing of this data, filtering it based on user-defined criteria like date ranges, geographical locations, and license numbers.
### 5. sdeMaps.js

This file manages the map functionalities of the application.

Map Initialization and Configuration: Defines functions for initializing the Leaflet map (sampleMap), setting the view to specific coordinates and zoom levels, and adding tile layers like OpenStreetMap.
Marker Creation and Management: Includes functions for generating markers representing individual samples on the map. Utilizes custom marker icons based on data attributes, sets up popups to display sample information, and implements highlighting functionality for selected samples.
Coordinate Parsing and Geospatial Calculations: Defines functions for parsing coordinates from various formats, including latitude/longitude, Degrees Minutes Seconds (DMS), and British National Grid references. Incorporates functions like haversineDistance to calculate distances between geographical coordinates, facilitating spatial analysis and filtering.

### 6. sdeSelections.js

This file handles user selections and data filtering.

Geospatial Utility Functions: Defines functions like haversineDistance to calculate distances between geographical coordinates, enabling features like filtering data within a specific radius from a central point. Includes a toRadians function for converting degrees to radians.
Sample Selection and Filtering: Includes functions to manage user selections of samples. The selectSamples function identifies selected samples from checkboxes and creates a subset of the data (selectedMeas) based on the selected samples, preparing the data for further analysis and visualization.

### 7. sdeTables.js

This file focuses on generating HTML tables for displaying sample information.

HTML Table Generation Function: Defines a function generateSampleInfoTable to dynamically create an HTML table from the sampleInfo data object. The function iterates through the object and builds rows and cells for the table, allowing for structured display of sample details such as location, depth, and area.

# Conclusion:

The Sediment Data Explorer is a comprehensive web application designed for visualizing and analyzing sediment data. It leverages several JavaScript libraries to provide a user-friendly interface for importing data, creating interactive maps and charts, and performing basic statistical analysis. This table of contents provides an overview of the application's functionality based on the provided code snippets.
